Project title: Who Am I?

Project description: The user is asked to log into Facebook so that the app can access the user's friend list. The app picks one of the user's connections and the user has to guess who that person is. A number of other random friends are added, so that the user doesn't have to choose blindly. After each wrong guess, the user is given another clue, but this lowers the potential number of points available.

 - Jenton Lee: PHP, HTML, JavaScript. Facebook and data scraping.
 - Eunkwang Joo: CSS, HTML, JavaScript. Scoring.
 - Dan Tsai: PHP and MySQL backend, JavaScript. Leaderboards.
